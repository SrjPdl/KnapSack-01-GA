## ðŸŽ’ KnapSack Problem
#### Task:
Given a set of items, each associated with certain weight and a value, and a Knapsack of certain capacity, determine the number of each item to include so that the total weight is less than or equal to a maximum limit and the total value is as large as possible.

## KnapSack 0-1 Problem
 Given a set of $n$, each with a weight $w_{i}$ and a value $v_{i}$, along with a maximum weight capacity $W$\
 $$ Maximize \sum_{i=1}^n v_{i}x_{i}$$
 $$Subject\ to \sum_{i=1}^n w_{i}x_{i} \leq W$$
 $$x_{i} \in \\{0,1\\}$$ 
 $$x_{i} = Number\ of\ instances\ of\ item\ i\ to\ include\ in\ KnapSack$$


This repo typically tries to solve KnapSack 0-1 problem using genetic algorithm implemented using python framework [DEAP](https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

## ðŸ›  Definition
There are 22 items that can be choosed from with maximum capacity of the KnapSack being $W = 400$ as shown below:

|compass|	13	|35|
|water	|153	|200|

## âš™ Usage
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SrjPdl/KnapSack-01-GA.git
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
If `pip` doesn't work use `pip3` instead of `pip`.
